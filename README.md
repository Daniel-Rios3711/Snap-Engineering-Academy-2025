This portfolio has 3 projects I've made for my CS30 class at El Camino College 

Project 1 is a double linked list map that I had to create using c++. 

Project 2 is an exceptions lab I had to make also using c++.

Project 3 is a smart_pointer lab I had to make. 

Each folder has the project files as well as the prompts that was assigned to us.
